           <p>Mae Borowski, a college dropout, returns to her hometown of Possum Springs, a decrepit former mining community, <br/>
            in an effort to pick up her aimless former life and make amends with the friends she left behind. But things have changed. <br/>
            Her pals have changed and grown, and her home seems different today. The wind is getting colder and the leaves are dropping.</p>

            <p>As the light diminishes, strange things start to happen.</p>

            <p>In addition, something is in the woods.</p>

            <p>Travel with Mae through her hometown and through the other side's shadows.</p>


            <p>The adventure game NIGHT IN THE WOODS is filled with dozens of individuals to get to know and loads to do in a gorgeous, 
             colourful setting.<br/>
             It is centered on exploration, plot, and character. Break things, play bass, hang around, 
             walk across power lines, leap between roofs, and learn strange, amazing, <br/>
                and awful things you never asked for. 
             Come home and let Possum Springs waste your life away.</p>

           </div>

           <p>
              <u> The game is:</u> <br/>
              intimate <br/>
               Charming <br/>
               Whimsical, and <br/>
               Occasionally heartbreaking 
           </p>

            <div class = "style">
              <h1 style="font-family:Brush Script MT"><u> Features of the game </u></h1>
            </div>

            <p>
        The game has a layered, two-dimensional design that nearly seems to have been slapped together.
        The game's colors are soothing muted hues that are ideal for the fall season. <br/>
        The game is quite visually appealing all around.
        The day is full with lovely subtle blues, oranges, and reds, but when you play through the dream scenes, <br/>
        it's all black with pops of vivid blue and red.
        Similar to how the game's narrative is presented, the color scheme establishes a lovely, soothing tone with eerie accents.<br/><br/>

        One of the nicest elements of the game might be the music. You can play the bass at band practice if you're in the band with Mae, 
        Gregg, Bea, and Angus. <br/>
        This takes the shape of a rhythm game, which you don't need to be skilled at in order to advance. 
        There is a great variety of music throughout the entire game, <br/>
        including calming tunes, eerie tunes, and rocking tunes. 
        Anyone who wants to give the game a shot will love the unique blend.
